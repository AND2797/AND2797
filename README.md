### Aditya Narayan Das

I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests are in robotics and computing, specifically in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and High Performance Computing. I enjoy working on challenging problems and bridging the gap between scientific research and engineering products. I am always looking for opportunities to contribute to open source projects!
